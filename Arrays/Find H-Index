Problem:
Given an integer array citations[], where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for the ith paper. The task is to find the H-index.

H-Index is the largest value such that the researcher has at least H papers that have been cited at least H times.
Logic code:
// User function Template for Java
class Solution {
    // Function to find hIndex
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        // code here
         int n = citations.length;
        int[] freq = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= n)
                freq[n] += 1;
            else
                freq[citations[i]] += 1;
        }

        int idx = n;
        int s = freq[n]; 
        while (s < idx) {
            idx--;
            s += freq[idx];
        }
      return idx;
    }
}
